<h2>ðŸ“¦ SOLID Principles Practice</h2>

<p>This repository contains a project I started to test and improve my understanding of <strong>SOLID programming principles</strong>.</p>

<p>In this project, I focused on using <strong>interfaces</strong> to manage actions cleanly and implemented an <strong>enemy system</strong> based on inheritance to avoid code duplication across different enemy types. The codebase is designed to be scalable, maintainable, and well-organized, following best practices for clean code and extensibility.</p>

<p>This project serves as a practical playground to strengthen core object-oriented programming concepts and improve overall code architecture.</p>
